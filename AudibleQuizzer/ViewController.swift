    let qa01 = QandA(question: "What is app lifecycle for an iOS application?", answer: "An iOS app progresses through different states from launch to termination, and responds to system notifications differently depending on its state. These states are: inactive or background to active to inactive, then suspended to not running", tags: [.intvCitibank202004, .iOS], source: "Apple doc")
    let qa02 = QandA(question: "How do you pass information from one view controller to another?", answer: "One method of passing information from one view controller to another is with dependency injection, which can be done at initialization or with a property assignment. The parent view controller assigns values in the child view controller; this enforces loose coupling between parent and child", tags: [.intvCitibank202004, .iOS], source: nil)
    let qa03 = QandA(question: "How do you define the run loop?", answer: "The run loop is a mechanism for managing and responding to events in an event-driven application. It is a process that continuously monitors for input events, and assigns each event that occurs to the appropriate target for processing.", tags: [.intvCitibank202004, .iOS], source: nil)
    let qa04 = QandA(question: "Can you describe coding keys?", answer: "Coding keys are nested enumerations that can be declared in a Codeable type, to specify the properties that must be included when instances of the type are encoded or decoded.", tags: [.intvCitibank202004, .Swift], source: nil)
    let qa05 = QandA(question: "can you describe 'app pinning'?", answer: "App pinning, also known as SSL pinning, is a technique for making mobile apps more secure, even when users use unsecure wireless networks. The target server's SSL certificate is saved in the app bundle. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that the app only communicates with the intended server.", tags: [.intvCitibank202004], source: nil)
